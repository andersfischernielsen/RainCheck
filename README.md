RainCheck is a macOS menu bar application designed specifically for cyclists and commuters who need to know when and where rain will affect their routes.

Unlike traditional weather apps that show general forecasts for a single location, RainCheck analyzes weather conditions along an entire journey to provide precise information on when to ride.

## Features

RainCheck provides four distinct advisory states:

- **Fully Clear**: No rain expected along your route
- **Clear Now**: Currently dry, but rain is coming - shows when and where
- **Raining Now**: Currently raining - provides timing for when conditions will improve
- **Partial Rain**: Mixed conditions with dry windows - identifies the best time to travel
- **Route-specific locations**: Tells you if rain will be "near start", "mid-route", or "near destination"
- **Intensity tracking**: Shows rain intensity levels to help you decide if it's rideable
- **Custom start and end locations**: Set your daily commute route

- **⛅ Cloud with sun and rain**: Currently raining with improving conditions
- **🌧️ Filled rain cloud**: Heavy rain or prolonged wet conditions

The text next to the icon shows timing:

- `15m` = Rain starts/stops in 15 minutes
- `1h30m` = Rain starts/stops in 1 hour and 30 minutes
